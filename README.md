Welcome to my AWS Learning Journey repository! This is a personal collection of notes, hands-on exercises, and diagrams that Iâ€™ve created while learning AWS as a beginner. Whether you're just starting out or need a quick refresher, this repository is designed to help you understand basic AWS concepts in a simple and structured way.

This repo is my personal notebook for future reference, but Iâ€™ve shared it publicly so others can benefit from it too. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! ðŸš€
